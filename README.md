# Heart-Attack-Risk-Prediction
This report focuses on analyzing the likelihood on getting physical condition data  gathered from hospital. The dataset contains 14 variables including age, type of chest  pain, maximum heart rate, resting blood pressure etc. The dataset was split into training  (80%) and validating part (20%). The goal is to predict once the patientâ€™s physical  information is recorded, whether heart attack will occur. We expect to run several models  on the dataset and find out the model with the best accuracy. The techniques includes  classification tree, logistic regression, KNN model and SVM model. The result indicates  that logistic regression model has the best accuracy on this dataset. We recommend the  one who fits the following three condition to check for heart attack risk: 1. Experiencing chest pain. 2. Over age of 60. 3. High maximum heart rate.
